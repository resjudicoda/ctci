# ctci

This is my personal repository for working through CTCI in Javascript.

The solutions here are all or mostly mine. I try to include comments in solutions if I looked to code from an outside source to help me solve the problem. The tests are written in Jasmine, and they are all mine. I build them out as I solve the problems.

Note - I work through these solutions before checking for an answer, meaning they aren't always the most optimal or clever. If you want to know CTCI's solution, buy a copy :).

Go ahead if you want to copy this repo. I migrated my finished solutions to separate files and temporarily disabled all but the first of each spec with "xit".
